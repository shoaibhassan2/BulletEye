    - **Full CRUD Operations:** Browse, upload, download, rename, and delete files and folders.
    - **Remote Execution:** Execute files on the client machine with a confirmation prompt.
    - **Drag & Drop Upload:** Easily upload files by dragging them into the file explorer window.
    - **File System Encryption:** Encrypt and decrypt files on the remote file system.
    - **Navigation History:** Includes back/forward navigation for easy folder browsing.
- **Keylogger:**
    - Remotely start and stop the keylogger on the client.
    - Download the captured keylog file to the server.
    - Securely delete the keylog file from the client machine.
- **Connection Control:**
    - **Disconnect:** Forcibly disconnect a client.
    - **Restart:** Send a command to restart the client's connection.
    - **Shutdown:** Send a command to terminate the client process.

### **Advanced GUI & User Experience**

- **Configurable Network Settings:** Fine-tune network performance by adjusting maximum connections, connection timeout, and buffer sizes.
- **Bandwidth Throttling:** Limit the upload and download bandwidth for each client to manage network usage.

### **Built-in Tools**
- **Icon Changer:** Easily change the icon of any `.exe` file.
- **Icon Extractor:** Extract the icon from an existing `.exe` or `.dll` file and save it as an `.ico` file.


## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Windows operating system.
- A C compiler, such as **GCC (MinGW-w64)** or **MSVC (Visual Studio)**.
- The **cJSON** library for JSON parsing. [2, 3]
- The **darkmode.dll** library for dark mode support.

### Building from Source

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shoaibhassan2/BulletEye.git
    cd BulletEye
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    - Place the `cJSON.c` and `cJSON.h` files into a library directory accessible by your compiler.
    - Ensure `darkmode.dll` is available in your build or system path.

3.  **Compile the project:**
    You can use a resource compiler to compile `res/resource.rc` and then link it with the compiled C source files.

    **Example using GCC (MinGW-w64):**
    ```bash
    # First, compile the resource file
    windres res/resource.rc -O coff -o res.o

    # Then, compile all C source files and link them with the resource object and libraries
    gcc src/**/*.c src/*.c -o BulletEyeServer.exe res.o -Iinclude -Llibs -lcjson -lws2_32 -lcomctl32 -lgdi32 -lshell32 -lole32 -lshlwapi -luxtheme -lwinmm -ldbghelp -mwindows
    ```
    *(Note: This command is a template and may need adjustments based on your specific project structure and compiler setup.)*

## üöÄ Usage

1.  Run the compiled `BulletEyeServer.exe`.
2.  Navigate to the **Manage Server** tab.
3.  Enter the IP address and port you want the server to listen on.
4.  Click the **"Add Server"** button.
5.  Right-click on the newly added server in the list and select **"Start Server"**.
6.  The server status will change to "Listening".
7.  Once a client connects, it will appear in the **Connected Clients** tab.
8.  Right-click on a client to access remote features like the File Explorer and Keylogger.
